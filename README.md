# My codes
This repo contains all the codes I made or practiced while learning Python.
I made this repo to keep track of my knowledge and skills and also to highlight my growth to the world.

In the folder *Hackerrank* are the codes that i submitted on the hackerrank python practice module.

### Note: Some of the codes doesn't work (only those that I made in the beginning of my journey)
Update: Aug 2024: Added comments to codes for better reading and learning using AI i.e Microsoft Copilot.
